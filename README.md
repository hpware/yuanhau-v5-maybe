# What is this?

This is a nextjs project, where I learn nextjs by building my website using it!

## Why a personal website?

1. Last version, yuanhau-v4.1 made me swtich from Vue to NuxtJS, which is a really cool lang, and this one, is my first try (prod project) on nextjs (yes, when I bought yuanhau.com it is running a blog template using nextjs).
2. A personal website is where I have some weird stuff I want to try out + stuff I like while NOT building my website like TailwindCSS & lucide icons! Those are awesome!

# yuanhau.com (rev v5)

This is the fifth version of yuanhau.com (or yuanh.xyz), which is built fully with a langauge I have not used in any prod projects due to a lack of Tailwind experince.

Prod: https://v5.yuanhau.com
